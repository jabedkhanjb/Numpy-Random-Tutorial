    "If there is a program to generate random number it can be predicted, thus it is not truly random.\n",

    "Can we make truly random numbers?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes. In order to generate a truly random number on our computers we need to get the random data from some outside source. This outside source is generally our keystrokes, mouse movements, data on network etc.\n",

    "We do not need truly random numbers, unless its related to security (e.g. encryption keys) or the basis of application is the randomness (e.g. Digital roulette wheels).\n",
